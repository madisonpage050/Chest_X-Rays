# Chest_X-rays
For this project, I used the NIH Chest X-Rays Sample Dataset on Kaggle, which contains 5% of the full NIH Chest X-Rays dataset, selected randomly. I used InceptionV3 as my model and based the data analysis and formatting off of Omar Salah Hemiedâ€™s code with the same dataset. The model identifies cardiac conditions. 

I wrote the code originally on Google Colab. I imported the dataset and CSV file from Kaggle onto my Google Drive, and uploaded the files onto the Colab notebook from my Drive. 

The dataset was imported from this link: https://www.kaggle.com/nih-chest-xrays/sample
Omar Salah Hemied's code is here: https://www.kaggle.com/omarsalahhemied/lung-diseases-detection
