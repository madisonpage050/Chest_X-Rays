# Chest_X-rays
For this project, I used the NIH Chest X-Rays Sample Dataset on Kaggle, which contains 5% of the full NIH Chest X-Rays dataset, selected randomly. I used InceptionV3 as my model and based the data analysis and formatting off of Omar Salah Hemiedâ€™s code with the same dataset. The model identifies cardiac conditions.
